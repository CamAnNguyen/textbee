/**
 * Subjects and email bodies for billing notifications, in one place.
 *
 * This used to live in two duplicated `subjectForType` maps plus message
 * strings built at four call sites, which had already drifted. The stored
 * notification keeps its own short title and message for the in-app list; this
 * module owns what the email says.
 *
 * Copy principles, since these are the emails that decide whether someone
 * upgrades:
 * - Lead with the person's situation, not the policy.
 * - Give the way out that costs nothing first, then the paid one. Someone who
 *   cannot pay still needs to know they can wait or split the batch.
 * - Never scold. Hitting a limit is the product working, not the user erring.
 * - The approaching emails are the real moment: the user is still succeeding
 *   and can act calmly. The reached emails arrive when they are already stuck.
